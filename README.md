This repo also uses `vcpkg` to manage dependencies. All building process is done by using `Cmake`.
For unit tests, this repo uses the `Google test suite`.


## Dependecies

- [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#using-vcpkg-with-cmake) (needed to install deps pkgs)

- [google tests](http://google.github.io/googletest/quickstart-cmake.html) (used to create tests)

- Installing Cmake deps (to work in multi platform)
    ```bash
    sudo apt install cmake pkg-config
    ```

- Installing the debugger:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install gdb
